# pyMagicBlue
Python script and library to control Magic Blue bulbs over bluetooth.

The Magic Bulb is, as far as I know, the cheapest bluetooth RGB light bulb on the market : you can get it for as low as ~8â‚¬/9$ on sites like
[Gearbest](http://www.gearbest.com/smart-light-bulb/pp_230349.html). It works pretty good and comes with mobile apps.

Unfortunattely I haven't found any API or documentation for it, which is why I started this project.

I haven't fully retro-engineered the protocol yet so it's not complete but
[Characteristics list page](https://github.com/Betree/pyMagicBlue/wiki/Characteristics-list) and
[How to use manually with Gatttool page](https://github.com/Betree/pyMagicBlue/wiki/How-to-use-manually-with-Gatttool)
should give you enough details to start working on your own implementation if you need to port this for another
language / platform.
On the [research/bluetooth branch](https://github.com/Betree/pyMagicBlue/tree/research/bluetooth) you'll also find capture of bluetooth packets exchanged
between Android and the bulb (open hci_capture.log with Wireshark).

Tested on Linux only. I'll be happy to get your feedback on other platforms !

## Installation
### Linux
You must use python 3+ and have a proper Bluetooth 4.0 interface installed on your machine.

    sudo apt-get install libbluetooth-dev
    pip install pybluez
    pip install gattlib
    pip install webcolors

## Usage

**Library needs root permissions to use Bluetooth features.**

If you run into problems during devices listing or connect, try to follow this procedure to ensure your Bluetooth interface works correctly : [How to use manually with Gatttool page](https://github.com/Betree/pyMagicBlue/wiki/How-to-use-manually-with-Gatttool)

### Using it as an API

    from magicblue import MagicBlue
    
    bulb_mac_address = 'XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX'
    bulb = MagicBlue(bulb_mac_address)
    bulb.connect()
    bulb.set_color([255, 0, 0])         # Set red
    bulb.set_random_color()             # Set random
    bulb.turn_off()                     # Turn off the light
    bulb.turn_on()                      # Set white light

### Using it as a tool
Script must be run as root.

#### Using the interactive shell
Just launch magicblue.py as root user :

    piouffb@Ordinatron-3000:~/workspace/python/pyMagicBlue$ sudo python magicblue.py 
    Magic Blue interactive shell v0.1
    Type "help" to see what you can do
    > help

    connect         mac_address              Connect to light bulb
    disconnect                               Disconnect from current light bulb
    set_color       name|hexvalue            Change bulb's color
    turn            on|off                   Turn on / off the bulb
    exit                                     Exit the script
    > list_devices
    Listing Bluetooth LE devices in range. Press CTRL+C to stop searching.
    Name                Mac address 
    ----                ----------- 
    LEDBLE-1D433903     C7:17:1D:43:39:03
    ---------------
    ^C
    
    > connect C7:17:1D:43:39:03
    INFO:__main__:Connected : True
    > exit
    Bye !

#### Passing command as an option
Script can also be used by command line (for example to include it in custom shell scripts)
Usage is defined as follow :

    usage: magicblue.py [-h] [-l LIST_COMMANDS] [-c COMMAND] [-m MAC_ADDRESS]
    
    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      -l LIST_COMMANDS, --list_commands LIST_COMMANDS
                            List available commands
      -c COMMAND, --command COMMAND
                            Command to execute
      -m MAC_ADDRESS, --mac_address MAC_ADDRESS
                            Device mac address. Must be set if command given in -c needs you to be connected
                            
So if you want to change the color of bulb with mac address "C7:17:1D:43:39:03", just run :
    
    sudo /usr/bin/python3.4 magicblue.py -c 'set_color red' -m C7:17:1D:43:39:03

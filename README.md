# MagicBlue - Cheap bluetooth bulbs

[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/magicblue/badge/?version=latest)](http://magicblue.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)

The Magic Bulb is, as far as I know, the cheapest bluetooth RGB light bulb
on the market : you can get it for as low as ~8‚Ç¨/9$ on sites like
[Gearbest](http://www.gearbest.com/smart-light-bulb/pp_230349.html).
It works pretty good and comes with mobile apps.

Unfortunately I haven't found any API or documentation for it, which is
why I started this project.


There are multiple versions of the bulb, some of them may need development
to be compatible with this project. If you have a different bulb version
you can try to sniff bluetooth communications. Reverse-engineering
information and pull requests are more than welcome üò∫

## Installation
### HomeAssistant
If you want to use this project with [HomeAssistant](https://home-assistant.io/)
you'll need to install `magicblue` as described below then use the
component available here: https://github.com/Betree/homeassistant-magicblue

MagicBlue is not compatible with Windows.

### Linux
You must use python 3+ and have a proper Bluetooth 4.0 interface
installed on your machine.

* Prerequisite

  - Debian: `sudo apt-get install libglib2.0-dev`
  - Fedora: `sudo dnf install glib2-devel`

* Install

  > sudo pip3 install magicblue

  Library needs elevated permissions to use Bluetooth features. You can either
  run as root (required for magicblueshell), or give `hcitool` special capabilities
  (see [this link](https://github.com/Betree/magicblue/wiki/Giving-hcitool-capabilities))

### Known errors

  * Bluepy not compiled (very common)
  
  If you get an error like `No such file or directory: '/usr/local/lib/python3.4/dist-packages/bluepy/bluepy-helper'`
	or `ERROR:magicblue.magicblueshell:Unexpected error with command "ls": Helper exited`:
	this is a known bug in bluepy that sometimes doesn't get compiled when installed from Pypi.
	You can fix it by compiling the helper yourself :
	Go to the lib folder (usually `/usr/local/lib/python3.5/dist-packages/bluepy-1.1.2-py3.5.egg/bluepy/`
	but could be different, especially if you're using a virtual env) and
	run `sudo make` (`make` should be enought for a virtual env).

  * Other errors
  
  If you run into problems during devices listing or connect, try to follow
  this procedure to ensure your Bluetooth interface works correctly :

## Usage

### Python API

Check the [API documentation](http://magicblue.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

### From shell
Script must be run as root.

You can always specify which bluetooth adapter (default: hci0) you want to use by specifying it with the -a option.

#### Using the interactive shell
Just launch magicblueshell as root user :

```bash
$ sudo magicblueshell
Magic Blue interactive shell v0.3.0

```

#### Passing command as an option
Script can also be used by command line (for example to include it in custom shell scripts):

```
usage: magicblueshell [-h] [-l LIST_COMMANDS] [-c COMMAND] [-m MAC_ADDRESS]
                      [-a BLUETOOTH_ADAPTER] [-b BULB_VERSION]

Python tool to control MagicBlue bulbs over Bluetooth

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -l LIST_COMMANDS, --list_commands LIST_COMMANDS
                        List available commands
  -c COMMAND, --command COMMAND
                        Command to execute
  -m MAC_ADDRESS, --mac_address MAC_ADDRESS
                        Device mac address. Must be set if command given in -c
                        needs you to be connected
  -a BLUETOOTH_ADAPTER, --bluetooth_adapter BLUETOOTH_ADAPTER
                        Bluetooth adapter name as listed by hciconfig
  -b BULB_VERSION, --bulb-version BULB_VERSION
                        Bulb version as displayed in the official app

```
                     
So if you want to change the color of bulb with mac address "C7:17:1D:43:39:03", just run :
    
> sudo magicblueshell -c 'set_color red' -m C7:17:1D:43:39:03

then check [open issues](https://github.com/Betree/magicblue/issues)

The protocol isn't fully retro-engineered but
[Characteristics list page](https://github.com/Betree/pyMagicBlue/wiki/Characteristics-list) and
[How to use manually with Gatttool page](https://github.com/Betree/pyMagicBlue/wiki/How-to-use-manually-with-Gatttool)
should give you enough details to start working on your own implementation if you need to port this for another
language / platform.
On the [research/bluetooth branch](https://github.com/Betree/pyMagicBlue/tree/research/bluetooth)
you'll also find capture of bluetooth packets exchanged between Android and the bulb (open hci_capture.log with Wireshark).
